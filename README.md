# Course Content & Goals
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design is a course that presents an introduction to the design and construction of software systems using techniques that view a system as a set of objects that work together to realize the system's functionality. This perspective stands in contrast to more traditional "procedural" or "structured" design techniques that viewed systems as a set of procedures that manipulate shared data structures. Proponents of object-oriented techniques point to the flexibility and extensibility of object-oriented systems along with other benefits such as increased modularity, abstraction, and encapsulation. 
 
In this class, we will examine fundamental objected-oriented analysis and design techniques and show how decisions made during analysis and design impact the implementation of software systems. This class does not focus on object-oriented programming; however, we will examine many examples of object-oriented systems written in Java, Python, and other languages. A primary focus will be the understanding and application of key object-oriented principles and design patterns. 
 
By the end of the class, students will have been exposed to the major steps of object-oriented software development life cycles and will understand the tools and techniques that are used in such development. They will also have applied these skills to the development of projects and the analysis of real-world object-oriented systems.

## Learning Outcomes
* Identify the principles of object-oriented (OO) design and describe their importance in writing maintainable software
* Define OO design patterns and distinguish the scenarios where they apply
* Design and develop programs using OO design patterns in Java software projects
* Construct UML and other diagrams to plan the structure of an OO software system
* Examine project requirements and choose how to apply design techniques and object-oriented design patterns for specific scenarios

# Course Requirements & Format
 
## Prerequisites:
This course involves extensive work in programming for projects and assessments and therefore requires knowledge of programming (this course will primarily use Java, along with some Python) and basic computer architecture. Corresponding Western courses include CS 190, 191 and 280.
 
Neither Java nor Python programming will be taught in depth as an in-class topic, although examples and code snippets will be reviewed and we will ramp up with Java prorgramming through the first project. Links for Java and Python tutorials and support materials will be provided for students to use as needed.
 
The class may also provide experience with other tools and languages, including but not limited to Git, HTML, UML, Amazon Web Services, various databases, and others. Prior experience in these tools is not required for the class.

## Course Materials and Textbook
Course materials include lecture slides, project guides, and other online materials, with frequent references to various texts and other resources. These will all be provided through Canvas (https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/95447). The textbook for the class is a required resource.

**Head First Design Patterns**
* By Freeman, Robson, Bates, & Sierra
* O’Reilly Media, December 2020 (2nd Edition)
* The e-book is also available via O’Reilly Safari (free access at CU Library online e-books here: https://libguides.colorado.edu/strategies/ebooks under the sciences tab).

## Coursework

Coursework consists of:
* Projects
* Weekly reading and quizzes
* In-class activities and discussions
* Midterm and final exams

### Projects
Students will plan, design and implement 7 programming projects throughout the semester, working in teams of two for all but the first project. Students will create diagrams, plan out, implement and test code, and write reports for their project work.

Teams may turn in one group submission for both members. All homework and reports must be legibly written or typed and must include all the students name(s) in the submission.

All homework assignments should be turned in at the due date/time presented for the assignment on Canvas. Late homework may be accepted but will be penalized as detailed in class or assignment descriptions.

Code and reports must include proper references to any supporting materials. Whether working as a team or leveraging software designs from books, the Internet, ChatGPT, or other sources, students are expected and required to cite and credit the source of the information clearly and completely. Plagiarism will not be tolerated and will be reported to the CU Honor Code Office.

#### **Policy on Using ChatGPT or other AI Systems**
The instructor's stance on AI is that it can be a useful tool to write a first draft of any written work, code or otherwise, but that it has limitations and should not be a complete replacement of original student work. If you choose to use an AI system, you must cite that you did so, explaining the following in your README file or code comments:
1. What you asked the AI to write
2. How you revised what you received or verified that the code was correct if you made no revision
3. Any code copied directly from the AI system must be labeled as such


All team members are expected to be able to explain the code in their project, and will be assessed via coding interviews.


### Readings & Quizzes

Weekly quizzes administered through Canvas will test your understanding of the readings required for the course. Quizzes are open-note and can be taken twice, counting the highest score towards your grade.

### In-class activities and discussions
Speaking about a topic, testing a design or writing code activates a part of your brain that will help you retain the content for this course. Class time will include in-class activities and discussions meant to facilitate this. Participation in these activities and discussions will be factored into your grade.

When you miss a session, you miss out on participating and contributing to the activities during that class. All students are expected to come to class having made progress with readings, course assignments, and projects and fully participate in class activities and discussions. The participation grade is calculated based on active involvement in class activities. 

**Here are some examples of opportunities for participation:**
* Contributing to in-class discussions: verbal and written
* Asking questions in class
  * Questions are a sign of curiosity and desire to understand, not of a lack of intelligence!
* Comment, build on or clarify others' contributions
* Writing or verbalizing comments during in-class code review
* Giving feedback on other students' code and designs
* Writing thoughtful responses in reflection forms administered during class

### Exams
Exams include a mid-term and final examination, with a similar format to the quizzes. The exam assessments are to be done using individual effort alone. Mid-term and final exam logistics, content, times, and locations will be scheduled and announced.

### Extra Credit
From time to time, there may be opportunities for extra credit. Generally, extra credit opportunities come with project work. Project extra credit will be described in project grading rubrics and will be awarded for individual or team projects when projects are graded.

# Course Policies 

## Evaluation and Grading 
Grading will be based on total points accumulated from each type of assessment and assignment used in the class. All points from class activities have the same weight. A student earning less than 60% of the points possible will be given a failing grade. In all cases, grades may be assigned based on a curve determined by the instructor.

The following table shows percentage assignments for final posted class letter grades:

| 94–100 | 90–93 | 87-89 | 83–86 | 80–82 | 77–79 | 73–76 | 70–72 | 67–69 | 63–66 | 60–62 | 0–59 |
|------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | -------|-------|-------|-------|------- |------- | ------- |
|A|A-|B+|B|B-|C+|C|C-|D+|D|D-|F|

Make-up Exam Policy: No make-up exams are given except for medical or other situations where advanced arrangements are made with the instructor; or in case of non-selective medical emergencies with physician’s note or documentation. Otherwise, failure to take the exam at the scheduled time will result in a zero grade in the exam.

The overall course grade will be based on the following breakdown:
* Projects 50% (500 points)
* Quizzes 20% (200 points)
* Mid-term and Final Exams 20% (200 points)
* Participation 10% (100 Points)

## Attendance
Attendance is required and will be evaluated as part of your participation grade. Attending class ensures that you and your project partner stay up to date with the material required to complete the assignments.

We understand that emergencies and disruptions happen, so if you have to miss a class session, we ask that you consult the syllabus, Canvas, and your peers to learn about what happened during class. It is still your responsibility to submit assignments and projects on time. Unexcused missed class periods will impact your participation grade. Missing more than 40% of the course sessions (of unexcused absences) will result in a failing grade in participation.

## Extensions & Extenuating Circumstances
Please refer to individual project assignments for late policies. Because late work within reason is accepted (with some penalty), extensions on assignments are not standard practice.
 
If you have extenuating circumstances that impact your ability to complete coursework, please contact the instructor or visit office hours.

# Campus-wide Policies

## Classroom Behavior 

Students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote, or online. Failure to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation, or political philosophy. 
 
For more information, see the classroom behavior policy, the Student Code of Conduct, and the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance. 

## Mental Health and Wellness

The University of Colorado Boulder is committed to the well-being of all students. If you are struggling with personal stressors, mental health or substance use concerns that are impacting academic or daily life, please contact Counseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS) located in C4C or call (303) 492-2277, 24/7.  
 
Free and unlimited telehealth is also available through Academic Live Care. The Academic Live Care site also provides information about additional wellness services on campus that are available to students. 

## Requirements for Infectious Diseases 

Members of the CU Boulder community and visitors to campus must follow university, department, and building health and safety requirements and all public health orders to reduce the risk of spreading infectious diseases.  

The CU Boulder campus is currently mask optional. However, if masks are again required in classrooms, students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to leave class. Students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution. Students who require accommodation because a disability prevents them from fulfilling safety measures related to infectious disease will be asked to follow the steps in the “Accommodation for Disabilities” statement on this syllabus. 

For those who feel ill and think you might have COVID-19 or if you have tested positive for COVID-19, please stay home and follow the further guidance of the Public Health Office. For those who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 but do not have any symptoms and have not tested positive for COVID-19, you do not need to stay home.  

## Accommodation for Disabilities, Temporary Medical Conditions, and Medical Isolation 

Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment. If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so your needs can be addressed. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or dsinfo@colorado.edu for further assistance.   

If you have a temporary medical condition or required medical isolation for which you require accommodation, {Faculty: insert your procedure here for students to alert you about absence due to illness, injury, or medical isolation. Because of FERPA student privacy laws, do not require students to state the nature of their illness when alerting you. Do not require "doctor's notes" for classes missed due to illness; campus health services no longer provide "doctor's notes" or appointment verifications.} Also see Temporary Medical Conditions on the Disability Services website. 

## Preferred Student Names and Pronouns 

CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's legal name. 

## Honor Code 

All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code. Violations of the Honor Code may include but are not limited to: plagiarism (including use of paper writing services or technology [such as essay bots]), cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty.  

All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution: honor@colorado.edu, 303-492-5550. Students found responsible for violating the Honor Code will be assigned resolution outcomes from the Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution as well as be subject to academic sanctions from the faculty member. Visit Honor Code for more information on the academic integrity policy.  

Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation 

CU Boulder is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. University policy prohibits protected-class discrimination and harassment, sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), stalking, and related retaliation by or against members of our community on- and off-campus. These behaviors harm individuals and our community. The Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) addresses these concerns, and individuals who believe they have been subjected to misconduct can contact OIEC at 303-492-2127 or email cureport@colorado.edu. Information about university policies, reporting options, and support resources can be found on the OIEC website. 

Please know that faculty and graduate instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC when they are made aware of incidents related to these policies regardless of when or where something occurred. This is to ensure that individuals impacted receive an outreach from OIEC about their options for addressing a concern and the support resources available. To learn more about reporting and support resources for a variety of issues, visit Don’t Ignore It. 

## Religious Holidays 

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. In this class, {Faculty: insert your procedures here}. 

See the campus policy regarding religious observances for full details.
