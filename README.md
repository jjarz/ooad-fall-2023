# Object-Oriented Analysis &amp; Design Western/CU Partnership Fall 2023

### Welcome to Object-Oriented Analysis &amp; Design!

How do software engineers write software that can be maintained and understood amidst ever-changing requirements? 

This course will be a practical guide to applying programming wisdom that has stood the test of time and many developers beore us. You will learn how to apply object-oriented design techniques, coding patterns and principles to common scenarios in designing and engineering software.

# Course Content & Goals
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design is a course that presents an introduction to the design and construction of software systems using techniques that view a system as a set of objects that work together to realize the system's functionality. This perspective stands in contrast to more traditional "procedural" or "structured" design techniques that viewed systems as a set of procedures that manipulate shared data structures. Proponents of object-oriented techniques point to the flexibility and extensibility of object-oriented systems along with other benefits such as increased modularity, abstraction, and encapsulation. 
 
In this class, we will examine fundamental objected-oriented analysis and design techniques and show how decisions made during analysis and design impact the implementation of software systems. This class does not focus on object-oriented programming; however, we will examine many examples of object-oriented systems written in Java, Python, and other languages. A primary focus will be the understanding and application of key object-oriented principles and design patterns. 
 
By the end of the class, students will have been exposed to the major steps of object-oriented software development life cycles and will understand the tools and techniques that are used in such development. They will also have applied these skills to the development of projects and the analysis of real-world object-oriented systems.

## Learning Outcomes
* Understand the principles of object-oriented (OO) design and their importance in writing maintainable software
* Survey OO design patterns, learn where they apply and program the patterns in Java software projects
* Construct UML and other design diagrams to plan the structure of an OO software system
* Examine project requirements and determine how to apply design techniques and choose object-oriented design patterns to specific scenarios

# Course Requirements & Format
 
## Prerequisites:
This course involves extensive work in programming for projects and assessments and therefore requires knowledge of programming (this course will primarily use Java, along with some Python) and basic computer architecture. Corresponding Western courses include CS 190, 191 and 280.
 
Neither Java nor Python programming will be taught in depth as an in-class topic, although examples and code snippets will be reviewed and we will ramp up with Java prorgramming through the first project. Links for Java and Python tutorials and support materials will be provided for students to use as needed.
 
The class may also provide experience with other tools and languages, including but not limited to Git, HTML, UML, Amazon Web Services, various databases, and others. Prior experience in these tools is not required for the class. 
 
## Coursework

Coursework consists of:
* 7 Projects: Designing and writing Java code 
* Weekly reading and quizzes
* In-class activities and discussions
* Midterm and final exams

### Projects
Project assignments will be based off of material covered in lecture and readings. 
When indicated, students may collaborate on homework as presented in homework details; a group of students collaborating on a homework may turn in one group submission. All homework and reports must be legibly written or typed and must include all the students name(s) in the submission.

All homework assignments should be turned in at the due date/time presented for the assignment on Canvas. Late homework may be accepted but will be penalized as detailed in class or assignment descriptions.

Code and reports are expected to be thorough work, including proper references to any supporting materials. Whether working as a team or leveraging software designs from books, the Internet, ChatGPT, or other sources, students are expected and required to cite and credit the source of the information clearly and completely. Plagiarism will not be tolerated and will be reported to the CU Honor Code Office.

### Course Materials and Textbook
Course materials include lecture slides, project guides, and other online materials, with frequent references to various texts and other resources. These will all be provided through Canvas (https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/95447). The textbook for the class is a required resource.

### Readings & Quizzes:
**Head First Design Patterns**
* By Freeman, Robson, Bates, & Sierra
* O’Reilly Media, December 2020 (2nd Edition)
* The e-book is also available via O’Reilly Safari (free access at CU Library online e-books here: https://libguides.colorado.edu/strategies/ebooks under the sciences tab).

Weekly quizzes administered through Canvas will test your understanding of the readings required for the course. Quizzes are open-note and can be taken twice, counting the highest score towards your grade.

### In-class activities and discussions
Speaking about, testing a design or writing code activates a part of your brain that will help you retain the content for this course. Class time will include in-class activities and discussions meant to facilitate this. Participation in these activities and discussions will be factored into your grade.

When you miss a session, you miss out on participating and contributing to the activities during that class. All students are expected to come to class having made progress with readings, course assignments, and projects and fully participate in class activities and discussions. The participation grade is calculated based on active involvement in class activities. 

**Here are some examples of opportunities for participation:**
* Contributing to in-class discussions: verbal and written
* Asking questions in class - questions are a sign of curiosity and desire to understand, not of a lack of intelligence
* Comment, build on or clarify others' contributions
* Writing or verbalizing comments during in-class code reviews of sample code
* Giving feedback on other students' code and designs
* Writing thoughtful responses in post-class reflections

### Exams
Exams include a mid-term and final examination, with a similar format to the quizzes. The exam assessments are to be done using individual effort alone. Mid-term and final exam logistics, content, times, and locations will be scheduled and announced.

### Extra Credit
From time to time, there may be opportunities for extra credit. Generally, extra credit opportunities come with project work. Project extra credit will be described in project grading rubrics and will be awarded for individual or team projects when projects are graded.

# Evaluation and Grading 

# Policies
### Communication
Participation in class is required - if you are going to miss class, please send me an email and we will discuss . There is no need to disclose why you are missing class. Missed class time will impact your participation grade.

### Expectations of me
Class materials will be made available on Canvas along with any assignments. Students are expected to keep up with the course material and assignments as they are presented. If you fall behind, or experience personal issues which prevent participation, or you need other help, please schedule an appointment with the class staff as soon as possible.
